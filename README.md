# LightNote
A light-weight command based note-taking application written using Tauri, React, and Vite.

## Application goals
- Provide a minimal command based UI for creating, deleting, and opening markdown files. *Status: nearing completion, almost usable*
- Provide a tag based workflow where notes can be assigned user created tags to link and catogorize notes. All physical .md files will be stored inside of a single folder. The driving idea behind this workflow is to remove folders and to provide a more user friendly way of catagorizing notes. *Status: To be started*
- Provide a powerfull plugin management system that can allow users to customize the existing UI and to add whatever features they want to create a fully personalised experience. *Status: To be started*
