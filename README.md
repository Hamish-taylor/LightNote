# LightNote
A light-weight note-taking application written using Tauri, React, and Vite.
Currently, the application is focused on just Markdown editing, as such it can only currently open .md files.

### IMPORTANT INFORMATION
*This is in very early stages of development!*
It contains the absolute bare minimum to be considered a Note-taking app, however, there are still many issues and caveats that would make the application all kinds of impossible to actually use. 

The application in its current state is ***Heavily*** inspired by [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) (Check it out, it's much better than this project will ever be), the long term intention of the app is not to be a clone of obsidian, currently I am just using it as a guide to help teach myself UI design before taking the application down its own path.
